Broadcast Audio Scan Service (BASS) for Generic Audio
#####################################################

This document describes how to run the BASS functionality, both as a client
and as a server. Note that in the examples below, some lines of debug have been
removed to make this shorter and provide a better overview.

The client is responsible for offloading scan for a resource restricted device,
such that scanning does not drain the battery. The client shall support scanning
for periodic advertisements, and the server shall support synchronizing to
periodic advertisements. They may both optionally support the
periodic advertisements synchronization transfer (PAST) protocol.

Broadcast Audio Scan Client (Scan Offloader)
********************************************

The BASS client will typically be phones or laptops.
The client scans for periodic advertisements and transfer information to the
server.

It is necessary to have :code:`BT_DEBUG_BASS_CLIENT` enabled for using the BASS
client interactively.

Using the BASS client
=====================

When the btaudio stack has been initialized (:code:`btaudio init`),
and a device has been connected, the BASS client can discover BASS on
the connected device calling :code:`btaudio bass_client discover`, which will
start a discovery for the BASS UUIDs and store the handles, and optionally
subscribe to all notifications (default is to subscribe to all).

Since a server may have multiple included Volume Offset or Audio Input service
instances, some of the client commands commands will take an index
(starting from 0) as input.

Example usage
=============

Setup
-----

.. code-block:: console

   uart:~$ btaudio init
   uart:~$ bt connect xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx public

When connected
--------------

Start scanning for periodic advertisements for a server:

.. note::
   The BASS client will not actually start scanning for periodic advertisements,
   as that feature is still, at the time of writing, not implemented.

.. code-block:: console

   uart:~$ btaudio bass_client discover
   <dbg> bt_bass_client.char_discover_func: Found 1 BASS receive states
   <dbg> bt_bass_client.read_recv_state_cb: src_id 0, PA 0, BIS 0, encrypt 0, addr 00:00:00:00:00:00 (public), sid 0, metadata_len 0
   uart:~$ btaudio bass_client scan_start
   <dbg> bt_bass_client.write_func: err: 0x00, handle 0x001e

Adding a source to the receive state:

.. code-block:: console

   uart:~$ btaudio bass_client add_src 11:22:33:44:55:66 public 5 1 1
   [00:00:58.460,000] <dbg> bt_bass_client.notify_handler: src_id 0, PA 4, BIS 0, encrypt 0, addr 11:22:33:44:55:66 (public), sid 5, metadata_len 0
   [00:00:58.460,000] <dbg> bt_bass_client.write_func: err: 0x00, handle 0x001e

BASS Server
***********
The BASS server typically resides on devices that have inputs or outputs.

It is necessary to have :code:`BT_DEBUG_BASS` enabled for using the BASS server
interactively.

Using the BASS server
================================
The BASS server can currently only set the sync state of a receive state, but
does not actually support syncing with periodic advertisements yet.

Example Usage
=============

Setup
-----

.. code-block:: console

   uart:~$ btaudio init
   uart:~$ bt advertise on
   Advertising started

When connected
--------------

Set sync state for a source:

.. code-block:: console

   uart:~$ btaudio bass synced 0 1 3 0 1
   [00:09:51.640,000] <dbg> bt_bass.bt_bass_synced: Index 0: Source ID 0x00 synced, BIS 3, encrypt 0
